      'Africans house the most genetically diverse DNA in comparison to all other world populations combined. In gathering insights from the African genome, we could power medical breakthroughs and discoveries that will change the entire landscape of healthcare, globally. We fully recognize the tremendous potential that this presents. Presently, most genomic data used for development research is from Europe, the United Kingdom, and North America with African genomic data only accounting for less than 3%. This is where we come in. We exist to close this gap by increasing access to highly curated genomic data from African populations.',
